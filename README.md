### Hi there, I'm Arturo Dix ðŸ‘‹


I seek to develop and stand out in the technological field with a focus on business. I am a proactive person who always tries to take advantage of opportunities and make the best of them. My mission is to add value to the development of technological projects and use my skills for social and environmental benefit. I seek to build an extraordinary future through my vision and perspective.

I like to have a comprehensive and holistic profile, which is why I have stood out in different areas throughout my career. I have been the creator of multiple community and entrepreneurship projects that have allowed me to grow my perspective. I have been recognized in areas such as entrepreneurship and public speaking. Personally, I like the technological field and the development of high-impact projects.

Currently, I work as an administrative and sales assistant (intern) at Matrix Fitness and I'm also studying a Digital Business Transformation Engineering.
